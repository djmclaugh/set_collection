# set_collection
Game about the sets you can prove exist using the ZFC axioms

## Status - Abandoned
Introducing the axiom schema of specification or replacement will bring in all of first order logic.
Since some sentences in first order logic are undecidable, it's possible to create two different sets without being able to tell if they are the same set or not.
This leaves me with two options:
1. Restrict the set of allowable first order logic so that every things remains decidable
2. Handle the case when it's undecidable whether or not two sets are equal (but then it will be hard to vizualize any kind of hiearchy)

These are complicated enough problems that I'm abandoning this project for now.
